# Popup Interface

## Purpose
Provides the main extension interface accessible via the Chrome toolbar, offering quick access to bookmark summaries, recent bookmarks, and core extension features.

## Key Components
- **index.html**: Main popup structure with bookmark summary, recent bookmarks list, and action buttons
- **popup.ts**: Popup logic handling data loading, user interactions, and communication with background script
- **styles.css**: Compact, Chrome-native styling optimized for popup constraints

## Functionality
- **Bookmark Statistics**: Displays total bookmarks and current conversation counts
- **Recent Bookmarks**: Shows last 5 created bookmarks with navigation capability
- **Quick Actions**: Provides buttons for showing sidebar and accessing settings
- **Navigation**: Enables one-click navigation to any bookmark from the popup

## Integration Points
- **Background Script**: Retrieves bookmark data and settings via messaging
- **Content Scripts**: Sends navigation commands and sidebar toggle requests
- **Options Page**: Provides direct access to settings interface
- **Current Tab**: Analyzes active tab URL to provide context-specific data

## Performance Considerations
- Optimized for sub-300ms load time with minimal DOM manipulation
- Cached bookmark data to reduce storage API calls
- Efficient date formatting and text truncation for smooth scrolling
- Minimal memory footprint with cleanup on popup close

## Testing Approach
- Test popup rendering with various bookmark data scenarios (empty, full, etc.)
- Validate bookmark filtering and display logic for current conversation
- Test navigation functionality and message passing to content scripts
- UI testing for responsive design and accessibility compliance
