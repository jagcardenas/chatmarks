# Options Page

## Purpose
Provides comprehensive settings interface for customizing extension behavior, appearance, keyboard shortcuts, and data management operations.

## Key Components
- **index.html**: Full-page settings interface with organized sections for different preference categories
- **options.ts**: Settings management logic handling form interactions, data persistence, and import/export
- **styles.css**: Full-page styling with responsive design and accessibility support

## Functionality
- **Appearance Settings**: Highlight color picker, minimap toggle, sidebar positioning
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Display and documentation of all extension shortcuts
- **Behavior Settings**: Auto-save, context menu, and floating button toggles
- **Data Management**: Export bookmarks to JSON, import from files, clear all data with confirmations

## Integration Points
- **Background Script**: Saves/retrieves settings via chrome.storage.local
- **Content Scripts**: Settings changes affect UI behavior and appearance in real-time
- **Chrome Storage**: Manages both settings and bookmark data with validation
- **File System**: Handles import/export operations with proper error handling

## Performance Considerations
- Lazy loading of settings with fallback to defaults
- Debounced auto-save functionality to prevent excessive storage writes
- Efficient file handling for large bookmark exports/imports
- Optimized form validation with real-time feedback

## Testing Approach
- Test settings persistence and retrieval across browser sessions
- Validate import/export functionality with various file formats and edge cases
- Test form validation and error handling for invalid inputs
- Accessibility testing for full keyboard navigation and screen reader support
