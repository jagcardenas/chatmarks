   - Efficient DOM manipulation and rendering
   - CSS performance and animation optimization
   - Event handling optimization

**Performance Requirements & Targets:**

**Core Operations:**
- Bookmark creation: < 100ms
- Text selection response: < 50ms
- Navigation/scrolling: < 200ms
- Search operations: < 100ms for 1000+ bookmarks
- Sidebar rendering: < 150ms initial load

**Resource Limits:**
- Memory usage: < 50MB with 1000+ bookmarks
- Storage operations: < 100ms average
- No impact on host page performance
- CPU usage: < 5% during normal operations

**Scalability Targets:**
- Support 10,000+ bookmarks without degradation
- Maintain response times with large conversation histories
- Efficient cross-conversation navigation
- Smooth performance with virtual scrolling

**Optimization Methodology:**

**Phase 1: Performance Profiling**
```typescript
interface PerformanceProfile {
  memoryUsage: MemoryMetrics;
  responseTimeDistribution: ResponseMetrics;
  bottleneckAnalysis: BottleneckReport[];
  scalabilityLimits: ScalabilityAnalysis;
}
```

- Use Chrome DevTools Performance tab for profiling
- Implement custom performance measurement utilities
- Create realistic performance test scenarios
- Identify performance bottlenecks and resource constraints

**Phase 2: Bottleneck Analysis**
- Analyze memory allocation patterns and leaks
- Profile DOM query performance and optimization opportunities
- Assess storage operation efficiency
- Identify expensive computations and algorithms

**Phase 3: Optimization Implementation**
- Implement efficient data structures and algorithms
- Add caching layers for frequently accessed data
- Optimize DOM manipulation and rendering
- Implement lazy loading and progressive enhancement

**Phase 4: Performance Validation**
- Benchmark optimizations against requirements
- Validate memory usage under extended scenarios
- Test scalability with large datasets
- Ensure no performance regressions

**Optimization Strategies:**

**Memory Optimization:**
```typescript
// Efficient bookmark storage with memory management
class OptimizedBookmarkManager {
  private bookmarkCache = new WeakMap<Element, BookmarkData>();
  private virtualizedList = new VirtualScrollManager();
  
  // Memory-efficient bookmark rendering
  renderBookmarks(visibleRange: [number, number]): void {
    // Only render visible bookmarks
  }
  
  // Cleanup strategies
  cleanup(): void {
    // Prevent memory leaks
  }
}
```

**Response Time Optimization:**
```typescript
// Debounced and cached search implementation
class PerformantSearchService {
  private searchCache = new LRUCache<string, BookmarkResult[]>(100);
  private debouncedSearch = debounce(this.executeSearch, 150);
  
  async search(query: string): Promise<BookmarkResult[]> {
    // Optimized search with caching and debouncing
  }
}
```

**Storage Performance:**
```typescript
// Batch operations and query optimization
class OptimizedStorageService {
  async batchInsert(bookmarks: Bookmark[]): Promise<void> {
    // Efficient batch operations
  }
  
  async queryWithIndex(filters: BookmarkFilters): Promise<Bookmark[]> {
    // Indexed queries for fast retrieval
  }
}
```

**UI Performance:**
```typescript
// Virtual scrolling for large lists
class VirtualBookmarkList {
  renderVisibleItems(startIndex: number, endIndex: number): void {
    // Only render visible items for performance
  }
  
  handleScroll(): void {
    // Efficient scroll handling with throttling
  }
}
```

**Performance Testing Framework:**

**Automated Performance Tests:**
```typescript
describe('Performance Benchmarks', () => {
  it('should create bookmarks within 100ms', async () => {
    const startTime = performance.now();
    await bookmarkManager.createBookmark(testData);
    const endTime = performance.now();
    expect(endTime - startTime).toBeLessThan(100);
  });
  
  it('should handle 1000+ bookmarks without memory leaks', async () => {
    const initialMemory = await getMemoryUsage();
    // Create and manipulate large dataset
    const finalMemory = await getMemoryUsage();
    expect(finalMemory - initialMemory).toBeLessThan(50_000_000); // 50MB
  });
});
```

**Load Testing Scenarios:**
- Stress testing with 10,000+ bookmarks
- Concurrent operation testing
- Extended usage session simulation
- Memory pressure testing

**Performance Monitoring Tools:**

**Built-in Performance Tracking:**
```typescript
class PerformanceTracker {
  trackOperation(name: string, fn: () => Promise<any>): Promise<any> {
    // Automatic performance measurement
  }
  
  getMetrics(): PerformanceMetrics {
    // Return comprehensive performance data
  }
  
  reportSlowOperations(): SlowOperationReport[] {
    // Identify operations exceeding thresholds
  }
}
```

**Memory Profiling:**
- Chrome DevTools Memory tab integration
- Custom memory usage tracking
- Leak detection and prevention
- Garbage collection analysis

**Quality Gates:**

Before any performance-related changes are approved:
- All performance benchmarks must pass
- Memory usage must stay within limits
- No regression in existing performance metrics
- Scalability targets must be maintained
